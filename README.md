# Scottish Snow Visualisation

This repo contains code for a small web app which uses Streamlit, Folium, and SentinelHub to display satellite images at 10m resolution over a terrain map. The app is targeted at several classic snow patches, and selecting a date range displays the least cloudy image in that range.

The app is available at: [https://scottishsnowvisualisation-ysgjiuhgwvvhdh93uv6ijy.streamlit.app/](https://scottishsnowvisualisation-ysgjiuhgwvvhdh93uv6ijy.streamlit.app/)
